# Edge Python

A compact, single-pass SSA-style bytecode compiler and stack VM for a functional subset of CPython 3.13 syntax. Hand-written lexer, Pratt-precedence parser that emits bytecode directly (no AST), and a threaded-code interpreter with per-instruction inline caching. Built for deterministic execution in sandboxed and embedded environments (≈ 130 KB WASM release).

## 1. Paradigm

Edge Python targets functional edge computing. The language treats functions as first-class values: lambdas, higher-order functions, currying, closures, comprehensions, and pure-function memoization are all central. Classes and method bindings parse for syntactic compatibility with CPython but raise at runtime — there is no inheritance, no instance state, no method resolution order. Imports parse for compatibility but raise at runtime; the VM has no module system.

What this leaves is a small, fast, deterministic core: arithmetic with arbitrary-precision integers, sequences (lists, tuples, dicts, sets, strings, ranges), control flow, lambdas with closures, generators, exceptions, and a curated set of built-in functions exposed as first-class values.

---

## 2. Architecture

* **Lexer**: Hand-written, LUT-driven scanner over CPython 3.13 token kinds. Tokens are `(start, end, kind)` offsets into the source buffer; no string copies during lexing.
* **Parser**: Single-pass, Pratt precedence climbing. Emits SSA-versioned bytecode directly (`x` -> `x_1`, `x_2`) with explicit `Phi` opcodes at control-flow joins. No intermediate AST.
* **Optimizer**: One peephole pass: constant folding over adjacent literal operands, plus dead-code compaction with jump remapping. Does not propagate through `LoadName`.
* **VM**: Stack-based interpreter over a pre-compiled `Vec<ThreadedOp>` where operands are baked into typed enum variants. Dispatch is a flat `match` over the variant. One LoadAttr+Call superinstruction (`CallMethod`).
* **Inline Caching**: Per-instruction type-recording cache for arithmetic and comparisons. After 4 stable hits the IC stores a `FastOp` (`AddInt`, `LtFloat`, ...) used as a speculative fast path with type-guard deopt.
* **Template Memoization**: Pure functions called repeatedly with the same arguments return cached results after 2 hits, bypassing full execution.
* **Memory**: NaN-boxed 64-bit `Val` (48-bit signed int, IEEE-754 float, bool, None, 28-bit heap index). Mark-and-sweep GC. Arbitrary-precision `BigInt` fallback for integers outside the 48-bit range.

## 3. Compiler Design

The store convention is SSA: every assignment increments a per-name version counter and emits a fresh slot. Control-flow joins backup the version maps and emit `Phi` instructions on exit so the runtime can resolve which version is live.

The single optimization pass folds patterns of the form `LoadConst a, LoadConst b, BinOp` into `LoadConst (a OP b)`, plus unary `Not` and `Minus` over constants. It deliberately does **not** fold `LoadName` even when the value is statically known, because keeping the load preserves the IC slot that drives runtime specialization.

What the compiler intentionally does *not* do:

* No SSA-wide constant propagation through `LoadName`.
* No CSE, no GVN, no LICM, no inlining, no closed-form loop folding.
* No dead-store elimination beyond what falls out of constant folding.
* No IR — bytecode is the only representation.
* No module system: `import` and `from ... import` parse but raise at runtime.
* No object model: `class` parses but `MakeClass` and `StoreAttr` raise at runtime.

---

## 4. Why this dispatch shape

* **Threaded operands** keep dispatch as a flat `match` over a typed enum rather than `(u16 opcode, u16 operand)` tuples. The Rust compiler lowers this to a jump table; this is *token-threading*, not direct-threading (computed-goto is unavailable in safe Rust).
* **Inline caching** records operand type tags per instruction and promotes to a typed `FastOp` after 4 stable hits. The fast path still re-checks types as a deopt guard; on a guard miss the cache invalidates and falls back to the generic handler.
* **Template memoization** caches pure-function results keyed by argument tuple. Functions are marked impure if they touch the heap (`StoreItem`, `StoreAttr`), do I/O (`CallPrint`, `CallInput`), raise, or yield — which fits a functional core well, where most user functions are pure.
* **No JIT.** Edge Python stays single-tier and pure Rust. Method JITs need per-arch stencils; trace JITs duplicate the execution model and complicate the GC contract. Single-tier loses on hot loops but is small, portable across `x86_64` / `aarch64` / `wasm32`, and trivial to embed.

## 5. Value Representation

64-bit NaN-boxed `Val`:

| Tag      | Encoding                            | Notes                                |
|----------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Int      | `QNAN \| SIGN \| i48`               | ±2⁴⁷ inline, BigInt above            |
| Float    | IEEE-754 (any non-canonical NaN)    | Quiet NaN remapped to canonical      |
| Bool     | `QNAN \| 2` / `QNAN \| 3`           | `True` / `False`                     |
| None     | `QNAN \| 1`                         |                                      |
| Heap     | `QNAN \| 4 \| i28`                  | 28-bit index into `HeapPool`         |

*BigInt uses a base-2³² limb array with Knuth-D long division. Strings ≤ 64 bytes are interned.*

## 6. Garbage Collection

Mark-and-sweep with roots: stack, globals, iterator frames, current slot window, and saved live-slot snapshots. Triggered by a configurable heap threshold inside `HeapPool::alloc`. `Limits` controls hard caps for sandboxed execution: max ops, max heap bytes, max call depth.
